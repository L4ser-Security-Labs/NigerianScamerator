# NigerianScamerator
An html form that generates a complaint to shut down the email address of a Nigerian scammer.
# Origin
I created this sometime in 2008 to semi-automate the process of reporting and shutting down the email accounts used by Nigerian scammers to extort money from their victims.

At that time, Hotmail specifically had a horrendous track record when it came to shutting these offending accounts down, so I wanted to create a pattern of clear, concise reporting of these accounts to hopefully initiate some change on the part of Hotmail specifically when it came to their response times for account shutdowns. It worked. As such I continued development of this tool, and added more and more elements such as which types of scams to report, which email account providers to report to, and extra messaging for whenever I cc'd the scammer on the report. (Mostly taunting language, pointing out how ludicrously stupid the scam message was, etc.)

# Usage

To use the Nigerian Scamerator, just open this single html file in a modern browser. Paste in the email address, the scam message headers and body, select (or find) the email provider, and then click on the "Go" button. Your report will be generated and pre-selected for the purpose of copying the entire thing into your email client of choice.

The page uses JQuery and use some very basic interface functionality. The rest is 100% custom JavaScript written by me.
